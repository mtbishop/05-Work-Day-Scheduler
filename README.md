## Work Day Scheduler

This is my work day planner/scheduler.

In this assignment I was tasked with making a daily planner to create a schedule.

 • When the planner is opened, the current day is displayed at the top of the calender,

you are also presented with time blocks for standard 9-5 buisness hours. ✔

 • When you view the time blocks they color coded to indicate weather they are past, present, or future. ✔

 • When you click inside the time block, you are able to enter an event that is saved in local storage. ✔

 • If you refresh the page the events will be saved with your local storage. ✔

You are unable to enter an event in a time block that has already passed.
